# Password_Generator

## Description
This projects goal is to implement a password generator to meet certain criteria in order to generate a strong password that provides greater security.

To meet the above criteria, I added character type variables, added a generatePassword function which incorporated the password length requirements and created a for loop in order to allow the code to be executed repeatedly until a strong password is generated.
